                        Many natives live in the Amazon. Their civilizations vary by region and tribe. 
                        There are also indigenous peoples who have lived in modern life with modern civilization by accepting 
                        their civilization by smoothly connecting with others through civilization that has not changed from 
                        the past due to closed life to open life. Be careful, if you come in contact with them, you must first understand 
                        and approach their civilization. That's courtesy and a way to understand each other. If they are hostile to you, 
                        it's best not to approach them first, but if not, it's best to study their civilization in advance and understand 
                        the smallest one by one.</div>
